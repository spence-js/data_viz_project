## Data Visualization Project for NEWM-N328
### Author: Spencer Johnson

Dependencies:
- D3.js (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7)
- Noto Sans - Google Fonts (https://fonts.googleapis.com)

I used a different version of D3 from the one used in class because all of the current documentation uses version 7. The only major change (as far as I understand) is that the d3.csv method doesn't accept a callback anymore and instead returns a promise, needing ".then" or "async-await"
