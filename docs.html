            <h4>About the Data</h4>
            <p>
                The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains cardiovascular data of hospital patients and whether or not they experienced a heart attack. The dataset can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmohammadinia/heart-attack-dataset-tarik-a-rashid"  target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            This dataset has 9 attributes:<br>

            <h4>Design Process</h4>
            <p>
                Since the data had a large amount of numerical data, I wanted to consolidate some of it into metrics that were easy to understand.<br>
                Since most people are familiar with heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (the top and bottom number in a blood pressure test, respectively),<br>
                I was interested in categorizing those numbers into normal and high ranges.
                I did the same with the less well-known categories (Blood sugar, CK-MB, and Troponin levels) as well.<br>
            </p>
            Thresholds for "normal" vs. "high" categorizations:<br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Column</th>
                    <th>Threshold</th>
                    <th>Source</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Age</td>
                    <td>over 45 years</td>
                    <td>Mayo Clinic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Heart rate</td>
                    <td>over 100bpm</td>
                    <td>Mayo Clinic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Systolic blood pressure</td>
                    <td>over 120mm/Hg</td>
                    <td>Mayo Clinic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Diastolic blood pressure</td>
                    <td>over 80mm/Hg</td>
                    <td>Mayo Clinic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Blood sugar</td>
                    <td>over 125mg/dL</td>
                    <td>Cleveland Clinic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>CK-MB</td>
                    <td>over 5ng/mL</td>
                    <td>Redcliffe Labs</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Troponin</td>
                    <td>over 0.01ng/mL</td>
                    <td>Cleveland Clinic</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

                In my visualization, I initially thought the best way to show this information was with a two-column stacked bar chart.<br>
                The two columns would contain the total number of positive and negative instances, then the layers in each bar would represent the<br>
                number of patients that fell into that category. I felt like that would not accurately represent what I wanted, since the number on the y-axis could<br>
                lead people to believe that the number was a total, but it is not since some patients experienced multiple symptoms.<br>
                <img src="./simple_stacked_hist.png" height="200" width="250" />
                <br>
                I decided on a donut chart because I felt it was a visually appealing way to show amounts of numbers and how they compare.<br>
                I also decided to use differing shades of red to indicate how strong of an indicator an abnormality was (darker red for the most common symptoms).<br>
                You will notice that the indicator with the darkest color is not the same between the genders!<br>
                I only used the patients that had experienced heart attacks, and I separated the visualization by gender.<br>
                The donut chart was selected because the perceived "total" is not a specific number, however percentages were calculated<br>
                from the total positive heart attack number in each gender. While this may be a bit confusing, I found the shapes for easily comparing between items<br>
                to be worth the compromise.

            <h4>Questions to answer:</h4> 
            <p>
                Which categories are the strongest indicators of a heart attack?<br>
                Are the numbers that people are most familiar with (heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar) better indicators than  the others others<br>
                for predicting heart attacks?<br>
                Do the most common indicators differ between Male and Female patients?<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Results:</h4>
            <p>
                Across both male and female patients, an age over 45 years old is the most common for females (90%) and second strongest for males (84%) most common attribute.<br>
                High systolic blood pressure (pressure in the heart DURING a beat) occured in 53% of males and 52% of females, however high diastolic blood pressure was present in less than quarter of patients in each gender<br>
                and heart rates over resting were under 10% across genders<br>
                Less than half of males and females experienced high blood sugar, while a slightly larger percentage (49%) of females experienced high levels of CK-MB compared to males (41%)<br>
                High troponin levels was the most common or second most common abnormality for males and females (86% and 76% respectively)<br>
                Upon further research, this is due to the fact that troponin is a protein that is found after heart muscle is damaged.<br>
